# Multiplayer Mirror
**This mod adds mirror options for your multiplayer avatar in games, lobbies and the avatar editor.**

### Options
You can control the options from the Gameplay Modifiers panel on the left in the lobby:

- **Enable Lobby Mirror**: If enabled, you'll see an avatar mirror of yourself in the multiplayer lobby.
- **Enable Self Hologram**: If enabled, you'll see a hologram of yourself in multiplayer games whenever you're in 1st place, just like other players would see.
- **Always show Self Hologram**: If enabled, you'll always see your own hologram in game, no matter what place you're in.
- **Show Duel Self Hologram**: If enabled, the Self Hologram will be shown in the Duel (1v1) layout as well.
- **Invert mirror**: If enabled, your lobby and game mirrors will be inverted, like you are normally on the results screen.
