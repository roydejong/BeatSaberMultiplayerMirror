# Multiplayer Mirror
**This mod adds mirror options for your multiplayer avatar in lobbies and games.**

### Options
You can control the options from the Gameplay Modifiers panel on the left in the lobby:

- **Toggle Lobby Mirror**: Show a mirror avatar of yourself in the lobby.
- **Enable Self Hologram**: When you're in 1st place during gameplay, show a mirror hologram of yourself.
- **Force show Self Hologram**: Always show a mirror hologram of yourself during gameplay, no matter what place you're in.
- **Invert mirror**: If enabled, flip left/right positions, like on the results screen. Affects both the lobby and hologram mirrors. 

### Notes
- Hologram mirror does not currently work on Duels (1v1 games)
- This mod's features, when enabled, will override and ignore MultiplayerExtension's "Hologram" toggle
