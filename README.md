# MultiplayerMirror
**Beat Saber mod that adds mirror options for your multiplayer avatar.**

Do you want to see if you look as cool in multiplayer as you think you do? Have you ever wanted to kiss your own avatar? This may be the mod for you!

## Features
MultiplayerMirror adds options for mirroring your own avatar while in multiplayer.

These effects are only visible to you. They work on any multiplayer server and lobby type.

You can toggle these options in the mod's gameplay modifiers panel (on the left, under *Mods* → *Multiplayer Mirror*).

#### Toggle Lobby Mirror
Show a mirror avatar of yourself in the lobby.

#### Enable Self Hologram
When you're in 1st place during gameplay, show a mirror hologram of yourself.

#### Force show Self Hologram
Always show a mirror hologram of yourself during gameplay, no matter what place you're in.

*Note: The hologram mirror only works for the Arena, not [yet] for 1v1 Duels.*
