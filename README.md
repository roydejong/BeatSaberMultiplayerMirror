**Beat Saber mod that adds mirror options for your multiplayer avatar.**



![Multiplayer Mirror](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6772638/136465227-bb4b0d5e-b1e0-49ca-8317-b2a24d4d524e.png)

## Features
Multiplayer Mirror adds options for seeing your own multiplayer avatar:

- Mirror yourself in the lobby
- Mirror yourself as a Hologram during matches
  - In normal mode: Only when you're in 1st place, for a free dopamine boost
  - In forced mode: Always feel like a winner even when you're not

ðŸ‘€ These effects are only visible to you. They work on any multiplayer server and lobby type.

ðŸ‘‰ You can toggle these options in the mod's gameplay modifiers panel (on the left in the lobby, under *Mods* â†’ *Multiplayer Mirror*).
