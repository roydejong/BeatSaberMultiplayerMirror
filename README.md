**Beat Saber mod that adds mirror options for your multiplayer avatar.**



![Multiplayer Mirror](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6772638/136465227-bb4b0d5e-b1e0-49ca-8317-b2a24d4d524e.png)

## Features
Multiplayer Mirror adds options for seeing your own multiplayer avatar:

- In the avatar editor!
- In the lobby!
- As a hologram during matches:
  - Normal mode: When you're in 1st place *(free dopamine boost)*
  - Forced mode: Always feel like a winner even when you're not

👀 These effects are only visible to you. They work on any multiplayer server and lobby type.

👉 You can toggle these options in the mod's gameplay modifiers panel (on the left in the lobby, under *Mods* → *Multiplayer Mirror*).
